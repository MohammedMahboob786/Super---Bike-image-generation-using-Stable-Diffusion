## Overview

This project involves the collection and description of a dataset of super bike images. The following sections outline the key steps and details of the project.

## Data Collection

- A diverse dataset of super bike images was collected. The quality and size of the dataset play a crucial role in determining the model's performance.

## Preprocessing

- The collected images were preprocessed by cropping them to a standardized size of 512x512 pixels. This preprocessing step ensures uniform data input and facilitates the model's processing.

## Model Selection

- A pre-trained model capable of generating descriptions for images was downloaded. This model may include elements of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image feature extraction and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformers for generating textual descriptions.

## Fine-Tuning

- The pre-trained model was fine-tuned on the specific dataset of super bike images. Fine-tuning involves training the model on the data to adapt it to the task of generating images to the tailored description provided.
